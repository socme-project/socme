# Things to change after various tests on the dashboard

## Administration stuff

- Clients list should be updated without having to refresh upon client creation
- Fix make guest/make user
- Do we want the information about the client to be shown in the client list? like passwords and all inside the application panel rather than the admin ?
- Fix the edit client button
- Open wazuh dashboard doesn't point to the right ip

## Alerts stuff

- Update alerts options (payment details, view customer?, weird to me imo)
- Change clients and tag buttons in alerts
- Displayed timestamp
- If i go to last page before searching, and then search, it should go to the first page immediately

## Random other stuff

- Ctrl K isnt aligned with the icons and some of the options don't work
- Change System theme button in the settings, and imo rename it in Ctrl K
- No need for the two UI bars besideds the dashboard logo, the search bar and github logo
- Fix typos
- Artemis clients status
- Last alerts, add space between severity and name of alert, + fields are weird when not in full screen.
- Add new thing on the dashboard
